Plan
-------

Step 1 -- Undo previous attempts to solve the problem.

Step 2 -- Redesign the type model for functions to depend on argument/closure types

Step 3 -- Create an alorithm to generate a dependency graph of return types to argument typesbased
          on function bodies

Step 4 -- Implement an incremental approach to calculating the return type of function calls

Step 5 -- Plug new algorithm into current interface
